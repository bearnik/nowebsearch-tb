NoWEBSearch for Mozilla Thunderbird
-----------------------------------

## Description

The addon disables the web search like bing, google, yahoo etc.
If you are annoyed from these kind of searches ... this is for you.

The addon does not mess with Thunderbird configuration in any way. It simply hides
the web search when you start typing.
